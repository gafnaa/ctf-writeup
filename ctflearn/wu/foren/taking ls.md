# Taking LS

Just take the Ls. Check out this zip file and I be the flag will remain hidden. https://mega.nz/#!mCgBjZgB!_FtmAm8s_mpsHr7KWv8GYUzhbThNn0I8cHMBi4fJQp8

## Solution
Extract the zip files, then extract the zip files inside again
Then, there is a pdf file, but after opening it turns out it requires a password.

Then, we look for the password. It turns out the password is in the `.ThePassword/ThePassword.txt` folder
```
Nice Job! The Password is "Im The Flag".
```
reopen the pdf file and the flag is successfully obtained.
