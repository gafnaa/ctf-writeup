My Dearest R.S.,

Across the entire fabric of space-time, I have found many an intriguing phenomenon, and for so many of them, a frustrating lack of documentation. Unfortunately, on a recent expedition to the Plutonian rocklands with my trusty companion, I sustained a serious injury, and it seems like that last adventure shall have to be my last. 

There is nothing quite like a brush with death that makes one rethink his entire life goals. The injury cauterized off a part of my soul that I daresay I will never get back, but I am distracting myself by putting together a chronicle of the universe. 

I hope I shall have the opportunity to show this encyclopedia, as I am calling it, to you in person. But you know me, I am never one to tempt fate. So herein I shall leave you with a secret code for contigencies: begin with the first code found in the fantastical kingdom from which all books originate; then revisit the gardens in dear old Trenton; and finally find the park in South Gate. 

My darling — I cannot wait to share with you the secrets of our mysterious universe, with its millions of whirling worlds and its vast, almost unimaginable distances. 

— R.K.
